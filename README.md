# Analyzing Sales, Margin, and Growth for Art Products in the US using Tableau

---

## Introduction

This project delves into the sales analytics of art products within the US market. Leveraging Tableau, we aim to derive actionable insights on sales distribution, profit margins, and year-on-year growth.

## Objectives

- Visualize the distribution of art product sales across US states.
- Analyze the profit margins associated with art sales.
- Gauge the year-on-year growth in sales of art products.

## Technologies Used

- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau Desktop
- **Data Source**: global_superstore.xlsx (Orders data table)


## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Open Tableau Desktop.
   - Import the global_superstore.xlsx data file.
   - Load the Orders data table.

2. **Sales Distribution Analysis**:
   - Create a map visualization to depict the distribution of art sales across different US states.
   - Use color intensity to represent sales magnitude.

3. **Margin Analysis**:
   - Construct a bar graph to represent the profit margin for art products across different US states.
   - Sort the states based on the margin to identify the highest and lowest margin states.

4. **Growth Analysis**:
   - Design a line chart to track the year-on-year growth in sales of art products.
   - Use annotations to highlight significant growth or decline points.

5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Combine all the visualizations into a single dashboard.
   - Ensure interactivity by integrating filters and hover-over details.

6. **Story Narration**:
   - Create a story in Tableau to walk through each visualization and its findings.
   - Use textual annotations to provide context.
